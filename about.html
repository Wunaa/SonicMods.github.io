        <h1>About the Mod</h1>
        <p>Sonic x Sonic Generations is a passion project aimed at reimagining Shadow’s adventure through the lens of Sonic. The mod replaces Shadow with Sonic, complete with custom animations, new character models, and fully integrated gameplay and cutscene mechanics. From the fast-paced platforming to perfectly synchronized animations, this mod offers a fresh, dynamic experience for fans.</p>

        <div class="story">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>It all began with a simple question: *What if Sonic took over Shadow’s role?* This idea sparked a team of modders to come together and build something unique. Through countless hours of collaboration, troubleshooting, and creativity, Sonic x Sonic Generations was born. What started as a small experiment has grown into a complete mod that offers an immersive experience from start to finish.</p>
